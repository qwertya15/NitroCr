## How do I use it?
*Note: This extension is intended for use with [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/ "https://www.google.com/chrome/") and probably won't work with other browsers...*

1. Download the repository as a `.zip` file to somewhere on your computer
2. Unzip the `.zip` file you just downloaded to somewhere also on your computer
3. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`, or open the options menu (three dots) ‚Üí "More Tools" ‚Üí "Extensions"
4. On that "Extensions" page, enable "Developer Mode" (top-right-corner switch)
5. Click "Load Unpacked" (near the top-left) and select the `NitroCr` folder WITHIN the unzipped extension folder from step 2
6. *(Optional)* Pin the extension: click the extension button near the URL bar (it looks like a puzzle piece) to open the extensions list and then click the pin icon across from "NitroCr"
7. *(Optional)* Customize some of the extension's settings by visiting its options page: click on its icon to open the popup, then click on the gear icon ![settings icon](NitroCr/images/settings.png) in the top-right corner

- Major improvements to the ad remover scripts
