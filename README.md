## How do I use it?
*Note: This extension is intended for use with [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/ "https://www.google.com/chrome/") and probably won't work with other browsers...*

1. Download the repository as a `.zip` file to somewhere on your computer
2. Unzip the `.zip` file you just downloaded to somewhere also on your computer
3. Go to chrome://extensions or Settings (three dots) → "More Tools" → "Extensions"
4. Enable "Developer Mode" (top-right-corner switch)
5. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the `NitroCr` folder within the unzipped extension folder
6. (Optional) Pin the extension by clicking the extension button near the URL (it looks like a puzzle piece) and clicking the pin icon to the right of "NitroCr"
