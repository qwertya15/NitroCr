1. Download the repository as a `.zip` file to somewhere on your computer
2. Unzip the .zip file you just downloaded to somewhere also on your computer
3. Go to chrome://extensions or Settings (three dots) → "More Tools" → "Extensions"
4. Enable "Developer Mode" (top-right-corner switch)
5. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the `NitroCr` folder within the unzipped extension folder
6. (Optional) Pin the extension by clicking the extension button near the URL (it looks like a puzzle piece) and clicking the pin icon to the right of "NitroCr"

## What does it do?
_Shiny new stuff in `[v0.7]`_:
- Page action(s) (when it's icon is clicked):
    - Current page favicon previewer
- Credits page
- New toggleable options:
    - "instant.page" script injector
    - simple ad remover that re-runs every few seconds
    - YT small ad overlay remover
- *No major issues (I hope)*
